# SpectateEnemies
 Allows you to spectate enemies in Lethal Company.

 ## Usage
 When dead, you can click to cycle through players as normal. After the last player, the mod will begin cycling through currently spawned enemies. Once all enemies have been cycled through, it will resume spectating players.

 In the config located in `Bepinex/config/SpectateEnemy.cfg`, you can enable/disable spectating Turrets and Landmines. By default, both of these enemies are disabled and cannot be spectated.

 ## Installation
 Requires the latest version of [BepInEx 5](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx). After BepInEx has been installed, drag `SpectateEnemy.dll` into the `BepInEx/plugins` folder in the game's root directory. You will need to run the game once for the `SpectateEnemy.cfg` file to generate.
